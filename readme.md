# BrightnessHandler
Get and set the screen brightness on my Huawei Matebook 14. Could be easily adapted.

I can't configure xbacklight properly so meh

## Get started

Clone this repo

Go take a look in your folder `/sys/class/backlight` to see the name of your device. Then in its folder find what looks like the current brightness and the maximum brightness

Simply fill the struct at the beginning of the main function and recompile it (Examples given below).

Required build tools:
```
- go >= 1.16
```

Compile it and move it to your system tools
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:oxodao/BrightnessHandler.git
$ cd BrightnessHandler
$ # Edit the main.go file to set your config correctly
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Then use it as you want, example for i3 / i3blocks:

```
# ~/.config/i3/config
[...]
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp   exec sudo bh add 10                                        
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec sudo bh sub 10
[...]
```

i3blocks config using [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

```
# ~/.config/i3blocks/config
[brightness]
label= ïƒ« 
interval=1
markup=pango
color=#676E7D
command=bh get

```
